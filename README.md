# PROJECT TITLE: : Exploring Trends in Crime Data in Birmingham between Aug 2020 â€“ Jul 2023

By Kaj Kabilan, Darryl Hewitt, Mushfiqur Rahman and Suwaiba Idris

## Purpose of the Project
Examine how different crimes vary throughout the year and determine seasonal patterns in crime types. Focus will be on time-series analysis, seasonal decomposition and data visualisation. The data we have from https://data.police.uk/ is of street crimes hence we are looking only at those crimes.

### Reseach Question 1 : What is the correlation between crime count and the Index of Mutiple Deprevation (IMD) score? How does the type of crime relate to the IMD score?
Hypothesis: There is a significant correlation between crime count and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score in Birmingham.

Above scatter plot showing total crime count in the LSOAs of Birmingham versus the crime counts in the City. In the above the plot we can see the linear line of regression showing a positive correlation of moderate value. This plot shows results that may support our hypothesis.

Scatter plots showing relationship between the LSOA crime count of Birmingham and IMD scores against anti social behaviour, criminal damage, violence and sexual offences, possession of weapons, public order, other crimes and drug related crimes. The r-values in these graphs show a weak positive correlation which is in line with our hypothesis.

The linear line of regression for anti social behaviour and robbery against IMD scores has a weak positive correlation.

The scatter plots above show very weak correlation between the crime counts of vehicle crime, burglary, "other theft" and theft from a person in relation with the IMD scores of the different LSOAs in Birmingham.

In this plot we see a weak negative correlation between the bycicle theft and shop lifting  in the LSOAs of Birmingham and  the IMD scores. The negative correlation in shop lifting could be explained by the distribution of shops in the city, where they tend to be more concentrated in the city centre area where the IMD scores are moderate.





### Research Question 2 : Where are the top 10 locations with the highest crime counts and what are their coressponding IMD scores? Conversely, where are top 10 locations with the least crime counts and what are their IMD scores?





With the seasonal changes in the country every year we wanted to look into whether there is any pattern to crime rate and types of crimes in the different seasons

### Research Question 3 : Are there any spatial correlations between crime rates and police station locations in Birmingham?

### Research Question 4 : Are there any trends in crime vs demographic factors?

## Aims of the Project
- To analyse historical crime data and identify any seasonal patterns in the different types of crimes in Birmingham.
- To cross examine crime rates in deprived and non-deprived areas of Birmingham
- To identify if the geographical distribution of crime rate is affected by the proximity of police station location.
